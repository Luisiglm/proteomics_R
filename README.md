# proteomics_R
Here we prodive a set of R functions and scripts to analyse proteomics data.
 ###### Repository:
- -[ ] **data/** A folder with the data from the TCGA consortium, dowloaded from Firehose and the Adjacency matrix from Reactome. 
- -[x] **layers.py** The implementation of different graph neural networks layers for multi omics data. 
- -[x] **models.py** Our implementation of neural networks models with graph neural networks. 
- -[x] **Preprocessing.py** Functions to read and pre-process the data. 
- -[x] **run.py**  Scripts to train and evaluate the graph neural networks models.
 ###### Dependencies
 Our implementation requires Python 3.6 or superior, plus the following libraries:
 - **R (version >=4)*
 - **numpy**
